# Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana Project Documentation Plan
The goal of this project is to create a "High Level" Project Documentation Plan with Metrics (i.e. deliverables, deadlines, etc.) clearly identified. Using the company **Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana**, the scenario is to develop a project plan for updating the current iOS mobile application of BCBSLA to improve the user interface of the app as well as update the map in the app to show available COVID-19 testing sites. In this documentation plan, there are clear metrics and objectives laid out to display the different teams involved in the software update project, as well as the project's objectives.
